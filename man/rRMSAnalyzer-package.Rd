\title{rRMSAnalyzer package for easy RiboMethSeq analysis}
\description{
The rRMSAnalyzer package is designed to give easy-to-use functions
dedicated to RiboMethSeq (RMS) analyses. All functions revolve
around the riboClass, a S3 class containing both RMS data and 
metadata.
}
\details{
The main functions are (in a standard workflow chronological order):

\itemize{
\item \code{\link{create_riboclass}} - import your data and create a riboClass. It is used by all other functions
\item \code{\link{compute_cscore}} - compute C-score for all positions in your samples
\item \code{\link{adjust_bias}} - adjust technical biases in your riboClass with combatSeq
\item \code{\link{extract_data}} - get a dataframe of c-score for all samples and all positions in your riboClass
\item Plots, e.g.: \code{\link{plot_PCA}}.
}

To know how to start using this package, you can have a look at the vignette at 
\code{vignette("analyses-with-rRMSAnalyzer")}. It will give an example for most commands
and a workflow.
